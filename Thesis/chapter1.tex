\chapter{Introduction}
The NHL as a league is over 100 years old\cite{NHL}; however, ``hockey statistics is in its infancy".\cite{Weissbock} Every year, publications, news outlets and blogs\cite{blogs} publish articles about projected team standings. While most publications strictly consider roster makeup and coaching systems,\cite{Publications} an ever-growing group of people are considering, for example, the ``individual impact on NHL 5v5 Shot Rates"\cite{shot rates} and how this would affect a game played, and are then running a simulation of the game.\cite{Magnus} My work is not going to be undertaking the same level of detail; however, I am going to be predicting NHL team points for the season of 2017-2018 and, when appropriate, whether a team will make the playoffs. This serves the purpose of predicting overall team success. My reasoning for these distinctions will be expanded upon during the discussion on how the methods for model building were applied. The models that will be explored are linear and ridge regression, a logistic model will then be built. The discussion will begin with an examination of the data collection technique, and an exploration of the variables. Following that we  look at the theory behind the methods listed earlier as well as the implementation. Finally, we discuss our predictions.
