\chapter{Conclusion}
If I was going to continue work on these models; the next major step would be to build supplementary models to predict our predictor variables in order to extend the models to predicting unknown or in progress years. I would also like to consider other variables that are commonly used in other areas such as WAR, Corsi, etc... I would also like to consider other machine learning algorithms that are commonly used in other non hockey related fields like Na√Øve Bayes Classifier Algorithm\cite{ML}
