\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract} In this discussion I use multiple linear and ridge regression techniques to predict National Hockey League(NHL) team points for the previous season of 2017-2018 as a method to predict overall team success. I also use logistic regression to predict the probability that a team makes the playoffs; this method can also be used to predict overall team success. For this exploration, 24 variables were used, and for the AIC prediction model, goals against per game was an influential variable. For the p-value model, out-shooting the opponent regardless of a win or loss increases the accuracy of the prediction. Finally, the logistic regression model predicted nearly every playoff team for the previous season.
