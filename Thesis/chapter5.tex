\chapter{Conclusion}
In conclusion, if I was going to continue work on these models, then the next step would be to build supplementary models to predict our predictor variables, extending the models to predicting unknown, or in progress years. I would also like to consider other variables that are commonly used in other areas such as Wins above replacement(WAR), and shots for percentage. I would also like to consider other machine learning algorithms that are commonly used in other non hockey related fields like Na√Øve Bayes Classifier Algorithm\cite{ML}. Another thing I would like to investigate, is the prediction of the Stanley Cup winner (league champion). In the AIC multiple linear regression model, defensive statistics were weighted heavier than offensive ones. The win condition model weighed shots heavily due to variable selection. The ridge regression model weighted teams which were the top of every category heavily. Finally the logistic regression model predicted every playoff team but one for the previous season.
